## QuickSort

- Quicksort is slightly **faster** then **merge sort** and **heapsort** for randomized data.
  - Particularly faster for larger datasets

Divide and conquer algorithm

- Select a _pivot_ element from the array, and then partitioning the other elements into two sub arrays, **whether they are less than or greater then the pivot**. This is why it is sometimes called the _partition-exchange sort_

> ### **Comparison Sort**
>
> Most are **not stable**

Average Case: **O(n lg n) comparisons on average**
Worst Case: **O(n^2)**
